following the rules that mentioned in LICENCES.md file is important.

If anybody breaks the rules, he/she will be:

1.1- warning for first time

1.2- suspension for second time

1.3- expulsion from the project, finally.

This project is very important for me because it is part of my assignment as a student of University of Pittsburgh.
